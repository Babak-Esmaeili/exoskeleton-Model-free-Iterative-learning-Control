## ðŸ§  Abstract

This study proposes a model-free adaptive iterative learning control strategy based on integral terminal sliding mode control (ITSMC) for exoskeleton robots. Without requiring an explicit system model, the method ensures high-precision tracking and finite-iteration convergence using only measured input/output data. Robustness is enhanced via a sliding surface that eliminates chattering while maintaining smooth control signals. Simulation results verify superior performance over existing methods.

## ðŸ›  Usage

To run the MATLAB code:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `.m` simulation scripts in MATLAB.
3. Customize controller parameters if needed.
4. Run the scripts to visualize the tracking performance and convergence behavior.

> âœ… No commercial solver like MOSEK is required. YALMIP-compatible solvers such as **SDPT3** or **SeDuMi** are sufficient.
