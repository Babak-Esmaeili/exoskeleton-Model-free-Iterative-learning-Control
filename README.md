## ðŸ§  Abstract

This study proposes a model-free adaptive iterative learning control strategy based on integral terminal sliding mode control (ITSMC) for exoskeleton robots. Without requiring an explicit system model, the method ensures high-precision tracking and finite-iteration convergence using only measured input/output data. Robustness is enhanced via a sliding surface that eliminates chattering while maintaining smooth control signals. Simulation results verify superior performance over existing methods.

## ðŸ›  Usage

The `codes/` folder contains two separate simulation environments:

- `codes/system 1/` â€“ MATLAB simulation for 2-DoF exoskeleton robot
- `codes/system 2/` â€“ MATLAB simulation for 3-DoF exoskeleton robot

To run a simulation:

1. Open the desired folder in MATLAB.
2. Open and run the `main.m` file.
3. (Optional) Adjust parameters or initial conditions to explore different behaviors.
4. The script will automatically generate plots showing tracking performance and convergence.
